    <string name="gameCastilloMuñatones">Muñatones Castle</string>
    <string name="explanationCastilloMuñatones">Muñatones Castle is located in Muskiz, Bizkaia.
        Somorrostro is a town in the valley, formed by the Barbadun river.
        It has around 7,500 inhabitants and the municipality is located in a protected natural space.
        We will find this castle we are talking about in front of the Petronor company refinery.
        Although it is called a castle, it is a tower house.
        It should be noted that it is not just any tower, but that of Lope García de Salazar,
        One of the most prominent personalities of the Middle Ages in Bizkaia. It was built in 1339,
        at the end of the aforementioned period.
        The current castle of Muñatones was built and destroyed over the centuries.
        with all kinds of wins and losses. Today, castle of Muñatones
        It is the only castle in Bizkaia that has preserved most of the characteristics of its time. </string>

    <string name="gameSanJuan">San Juan Night</string>
    <string name="explanationSanJuan">St Juan is known as the shortest day of the year, although in fact actual date is June 21st.
        When is the summer solstice celebrated? The adaptation made by Christianism explains that it does not coincide with the summer solstice. Tonight with San Joan
        will be celebrated, fire burns everything, fire is desired and summer will be welcomed. In addition to being a magical day, it can also ward off bad spirits or what happened
        breaking with bad things. In the past, these fires were lit to give more power to the sun and thus extend the light.
        In the past, it was celebrated as a pagan festival, as the sun was considered a god. With the advent of Christianity, the celebration changed, but it has never lost its essence.
        Nowadays, tradition and rituals are mixed, and everyone celebrates as they want, dancing around the fire, jumping over it, enjoying the night.
        The origin of this date is the day of the birth of Saint John the Baptist, as his father Zacharias ordered a fire to be lit to announce the birth of his son.
        In Muskizen, the descent of the torches, which starts at the station at 22:30, is of great importance. Then, around 11:30 p.m., the fireworks start, followed by a verbena.
        That night, people who come to Muskize light torches up to the old warehouse of Petronor, together with the whistlers, and then throw the torches into the bonfire of San Jorge.

It had two arched eyes, but today it has one, as the other sank in the Carlistlands, and a concrete walkway has been built in its place today. It is approximately two meters wide and has no protective walls. To prevent the bridge from falling, a large pillar has been built.
